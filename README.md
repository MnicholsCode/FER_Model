# Facial Expression Recognition

This group assignment was taxed with the four of us to create a model using the data given by kaggle. We used accuracy for our model and we are tasked to reach the highest accuracy we can. Exploratory data analysis was used to determine how we will achieve this. We created multiple models to create an ensemble and meta model
to increase accuracy. There is a pdf file which serves as all that was done and learned during this process.  

The [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/malcolmnichols/fer-meta-model/notebook) workbook is also referenced here so you can view this version to get a better look at what was done.
